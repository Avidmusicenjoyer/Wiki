## It took some effort

But that effort is worth it with the new commenting system! With the help of <mark>@codertek</mark> and <mark>@flustix</mark>, a commenting system is now in place. With this new commenting system, there are also things you, the user, need to be mindful of. We have added a [Terms of Service](<{% link postsInclude/_posts/legal/2024-01-27-terms-of-service.md %}>) and [Privacy Policy](<{% link postsInclude/_posts/legal/2024-01-27-privacy-policy.md %}>) for the site because we *need* to, it's legal mumbo jumbo, tbh. We also argued about a button in the designs for a good 20 minutes.

There are still a few incomplete features that haven't been implemented, such as:

- Proper Mobile Layout
- Upvotes and Downvotes
- Nested Replies

We hope you understand. We hope you enjoy the base commenting system we have in place now! If you have any questions *don't hesitate to leave a reply to this article*.
