## Hey

We redeisgned the wiki again to make it cooler. Including adding newsposts and making things easier(?) to navigate.

Internally, we have also restructed which posts and shown and removed the articles folder as I didn't think that was good approach to sort things properly.

I hope you like the new wiki design! I tried to mimic other wikis and news sites and I think I did that pretty well. This has been a big learning experience with design and implementation for me personally, and I would like to thank the contributors who have given me feedback and helped me with questions.

Still, there are some issues or oversights that may have slipped through review, such as clicking the search result container still hides it for some reason.. But if you click the links inside of that container, it won't hide. The script for it internally is.. weird, hopefully someone fixes it soon!
