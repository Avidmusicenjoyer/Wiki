## What is a CMS?

Well, let's put it this way. It makes things easier for everyone, especially normal users. CMS stands for Content Management System. Pretty cool, right? The site now has a nice editor for markdown (or rich text), so people can write new entries quickly and easily. You can try it now by clicking "Edit this Page!" at the top right!
