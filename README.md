## Listen here before contributing

Make sure to merge into the beta branch, never merge to main.
Quality checkers will go ahead and merge your code if it's good!

## DO NOT EDIT CSS FILES

This project uses .scss (sassy CSS)! Please be sure to know how scss works
before contributing to styles. [Install the .scss extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass)!
You could also review how to install Sass [here](https://sass-lang.com/install/). I installed it personally by using node.js in the command line by typing `npm install -g sass`.

## BE SURE TO KNOW HOW JEKYLL WORKS

Before contributing, learn how to use markdown and install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

## TESTING LOCALLY

Before testing locally, you must have Jekyll (and Sassy CSS, if you want to contribute to styles) installed properly. Once that is handled, open the terminal and type `bundle exec jekyll serve` in order to build the site on a local server. Afterward, browse to http://localhost:4000/ to view the website locally. If you still need help, review [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)!
