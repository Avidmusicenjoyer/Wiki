## Before Contributing...

If you are wanting to contribute to a single entry (like a wiki entry, etc.), you can use the "Edit This Page" button!

Make sure to merge changes into the beta branch, **never** merge to main.
Quality checkers will go ahead and merge your if it's good!

### Installing Jekyll
To install Jekyll, please refer to the [Jekyll Installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) page.

### Please, never edit the CSS files.
Because this project uses Sass (Sassy CSS), it will automatically convert your styling to the proper CSS files.
Please be sure to [install the .scss extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass)!
To learn how to use Sass [here](https://sass-lang.com/install/).
To install Sass with NodeJS, please run: `npm install -g sass`.

## Testing Locally

If you want to test locally, please follow these steps:
1. Install Git and Jekyll (if you are contributing to styling, install Sass)
2. Open your terminal of choice
3. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/CamelliaCommunity/Wiki`
4. Go inside the newly created folder with the clone
5. Run `bundle install` to install the gems required
6. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to run the local server
7. Enter the URL it provides (like http://localhost:4000/) in your browser to view your local copy
Please refer to the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) if you are still unsure!
