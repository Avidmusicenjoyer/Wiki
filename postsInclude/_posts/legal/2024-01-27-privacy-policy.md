Welcome to the Camellia Wiki! We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This document outlines what we collect, how we use, and what information we disclose you provide through flowertek and the Camellia Wiki Comments (hereinafter "our services").

### 1. What We Collect

When submitting a comment, we will collect personal and non-personal identifiable information. For example, we will collect the following personal information: Discord User IDs. The non-personal information we collect is comments (for instance, timestamps and post content).

### 2. How We Use Your Information

The information you provide to us will be publicly displayed to all users of the Camellia Wiki. However, when displaying the data provided to our services, the Discord UserID will be converted to the Discord username.

### 3. How We Protect Your Information

We take the protection of your information seriously and employ various security measures to safeguard it against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include but are not limited to:

- Limiting the access to the hosting server that hosts our services to very a select few.
- Conducting regular audits and assessments to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses in our systems.
- Collecting only what we need for our services, which helps reduce the risk associated with storing excessive or unnecessary data.

### 4. Data Retention

We will retain all provided data unless it is removed either at your request or through moderation. Upon processing the deletion request, our services may display a 'Comment was deleted' message, indicating that the content has been removed. However, apart from the Comment ID, all connected data will be promptly erased, unless otherwise noted. Users accessing the services after the deletion will only encounter the deleted message, with the Comment ID being the sole remaining identifier.

### 5. Your Rights

You have rights regarding your personal information. This includes accessing, correcting, or deleting your data. To request access, corrections, or remove your information, please get in touch with us through the means provided in the Contact Us section.

### 6. Disclosure of Information

We do not sell nor disclose your information to third parties.

### 7. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to modify or replace this Privacy Policy at any time. It is your responsibility to review this policy periodically for changes. By continuing to access or use our services after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised policy.
