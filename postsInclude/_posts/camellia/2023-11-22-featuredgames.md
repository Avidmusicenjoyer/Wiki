## Rhythm Games

It wouldn't be Camellia without him being in a lot of rhythm games, and there are a lot of rhythm games he is in, but before we dive into all the rhythm games he is in, let's define what a rhythm game is. A rhythm game is a game where you have to send input to the beat of some music, whether it's by swinging your controllers in the arrow direction, matching the colors, clicking some keys, or some other input. A Normal rhythm game would have difficulties depending on your skill level, ranging from an easy chart, to one that is literally almost unplayable. Since Camellia is a music artist, it is no surprise that he would be in rhythm games, but to say that he is in a lot, would be an understatement. This page will give you all the rhythm games he is in, from the most common, to the rare rhythm games. (If I miss anything, please tell me :D)

## Sound Voltex

Sound Voltex is an Arcade Rhythm Game where you have to hit notes coming from a distance, hold notes if needed, and use the knobs on the side of the controller to control colored notes called lasers. This is one of the first rhythm games Camellia has been featured in. Let's put all the songs in a list in no particular order, because idk which came before which. This will not include remixes except one that was rejected due to some reasons.

999 (RoughSketch - 666 (Camellia's Rejected Remix))

You may wonder why 999 is included even though it's not in Sound Voltex. It's because it was originally suppose to be part of the game before it was rejected because of either being too fast for the charters to chart (due to MAYHEM by RoughSketch being 998 BPM), or some other reasons.
