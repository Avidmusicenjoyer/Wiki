## December 2023

With 2023 finally ending, let's take a moment to think about all that's gone on this year... For now, though, let's review what happened in the last month of the year: December!

![December 2023 Monthly Logo](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/483188272256778250/1192629591018307594/Untitled16_20240105074044.png)

### We're back to the canvas again, with more Camellia to be drawn

After all the spooky and birthday spirit shown in everyone's drawings back in the previous drawing contest, we've put you all to the test of Christmas spirit by providing some festive and jolly entries for the [winter drawing event!](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1123866069438840883/1184616225066725416) You still have until January 10th to submit a drawing, so time is still available to make a masterpiece!

### TANO\*C TOUR 2024

It has recently been revealed that Camellia will play at the TANO\*C TOUR 2024 live event this year, taking place at the EX Theater Roppongi in Tokyo on June 8th! If you can‚Äôt catch the event in person, the set will be uploaded to the official HARDCORE TANO\*C YouTube channel at a to-be-determined date after the event. For more info, please visit the [official event website](https://www.tano-c.net/tour2024/).

### Tokyo e-Sports Festa 2024

Even more recently, Camellia revealed [his appearance](https://twitter.com/esportsfesta/status/1739921991225024750) as a performer on TEF2024, with him taking place at the Tokyo Big Sight on January 27th! It will be broadcasted on platforms like their [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@user-ni3jw1nk2v) channel, so even if you can‚Äôt attend in person, you won‚Äôt have to miss out on the show! For more info, please visit the [official event website](https://tokyoesportsfesta.jp/?p=188).

### New Releases

[Nobody Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaCt-EG1pjs): Camellia started off December with a spooky & festive collab with Yuzuki Choco, establishing another winter song in his discography, one to succeed his collab with Nanahira four years ago, ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm Not Interested In Christmas At All‚Äù!

[Tempo Katana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baxUutvrj2g): Camellia has returned to kill everyone's arms with a new song from Beat Saber OST 6! Charted to nearly the brim of difficulty in any of the official charts, prepare for a harsh 9.02 notes per second blasting at anyone who dares attempt the Expert+ difficulty...

[Snacko Remixes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaN19gIKi5ZpnWIoRPZiSIXyHNoAt498d): In an unexpected twist, Camellia has taken the time and harvested seven new remixes for the [Snacko OST](https://dalenorth.bandcamp.com/album/snacko-original-game-soundtrack) by Dale North. The game is still being worked on, but in the meantime, support [Snacko](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1125510/Snacko/) in its preparation for a fresh, early release!

[Antineutrino Witchcraft](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQS57GsE7UQ>): What's an osu! tournament without a custom-made Camellia song at the end? In a collaborative effort with the EGCS team & Transendium, Camellia officially revealed this brutal, raw finale of a song for the [EGCS 2023](<https://gtsosu.com/2023/egcs/home>) Grand Finals Tiebreaker! For all osu!catch players, prepare with however many fingers you need to use because no mercy was shown in the [song‚Äôs map](<https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/2101746#fruits/4409194>)...

[Sugoi Invincible](https://youtu.be/xlDk5c1z1yA): In collaboration with Panno Mimimi, Camellia pushes through the month by producing a chaotic-yet-catchy song! You can view Panno-San's YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/@PannoMimimi).

### Server Stuff

#### Mimu's Shop Revamp

While introducing the new economy and brand new shop with release roles was great, there was room for improvement. Throughout a couple of weeks, with the help of you guys providing feedback on tons of new additions to the shop and reworks regarding the shop's pricing, we were able to completely rehaul everything our shopkeeper, Mimu, had to provide when it first started selling to you guys! (Thanks to <mark>@H.I.P.E</mark> for their work on role icons and everyone who contributed in [#üí°server-direction](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1034240760154947584))!

#### A Shifting Staff Team

The past month or two have seen a few significant changes in the staff team, including the arrival (and departure) of some friends over at the Nanahira server, as well as the resignation of Chai, who was a major contributor to past editions of this very article you‚Äôre reading. Although we have seen many friends join and leave our ranks, rest assured that those of us here will continue to do our best to ensure this server is a place you all will enjoy being in.

#### For 2024, we‚Äôre also applying a ton of different things! Including

1. Enforcing the new Staff Guidelines
1. Removing <mark>@Challenges Judge</mark>, <mark>@Minecraft Helper</mark> and, <mark>@Event Organizer</mark> in favor of <mark>@Community Contributor</mark> (this update is still not immediate because we have <mark>@Toxism</mark> still relying on <mark>@Challenges Judge</mark> for now).
1. Implementing [Ko-fi community funding](https://ko-fi.com/camelliacommunity).
1. <mark>@papertek</mark> "Pinging everyone is nono, only for Camellia Monthly" Pinging everyone is nono, only for Camellia monthly & genuinely Crucial situations/problems that affect the server*

And more to come. :)

#### P.S

If you want a piece of the action, [staff applications](https://forms.gle/Abfe4di62m1cHUWh8) are still open! We‚Äôd love to see you on board, so feel free to check it out if you‚Äôd like.

Thank you all for a great 2023, let's work together to have even more fun in 2024!

## October 2023

The spooky month is officially over, but what isn‚Äôt? Camellia Monthly!

### We Drew Camellia Together, Again

With the success of the first edition, this time, we‚Äôve asked you all to provide some birthday and spooky entries to this version! Assembled by [many artists](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1088625892105924648/1170498148049879152), we thank everyone who participated. Look out for another event like this in the future!

### Camellia Reaches 200k Followers on Xitter

Thank you to everyone for helping him reach this impressive milestone. Make sure to follow him on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/cametek.bsky.social) too!

### Song Releases - October

[Hou { Phoenix }](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/ddr/ddra3/p/): Camellia didn‚Äôt seem satisfied breaking our hands‚Ä¶ so now he‚Äôs targeting our legs... The man has created a monster of a track in DDR A3‚Äôs ‚ÄúBabylon‚Äôs Galaxy‚Äù event as the ONE MORE EXTRA STAGE! Good luck to all those dancers; don‚Äôt break too many legs!

[i - ii](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/2dx/31/): What‚Äôs an IIDX game without Camellia in it? Bringing in his banger hi-tech psy style, get those DJ hands ready for some Metro Techno action with this unlockable song!

With another Hololive Collab, Camellia's brought us "„Åæ„Çì„Å™„Åã„Å°„Å¶„Çì" by Luna Himemori! [Check it out here](https://youtu.be/M0Oud1_4sl0).

Camellia has also produced another song named "„ÄåTrick star„Äç" by „Çã„Å™„Å£„Å°‚òÜ„Åª„Åó. Be sure to [check it out too](https://youtu.be/1DngUauUYjg)!

### New Staff Members

 Some of you might notice that three new admins have joined us - <mark>@azunyan0007, @ungrave, and @nicocchi_,</mark> have come over from the Nanahira community to offer help! Feel free to welcome them if you see them interacting in general chat. With them helping out, our admin team now forms a cool heptagon (probably a more relaxed shape than a square?). We‚Äôre grateful they‚Äôll be volunteering their time to help all of us out, and we look forward to working with them!

### Staff and Rules Updates

We have cut down *many* rules and combined some to make things more sane for new and existing members (from 17 down to 7!). We also added some clarification on current disclaimers as well as old ones. Please give them a read: <#1121280346638524456>. In parallel, we have also updated the Staff Guidelines again, adding an entirely [new section](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1088625892105924648/1164858060578230326) to it. An autobiography/transparency document was also [uploaded by papertek](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1088625892105924648/1167233462927904858), documenting his time in the community. Lastly, server moderation systems have switched off from Dyno to Wick. The full announcement is [here](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1088625892105924648/1169401636754563145). With these changes and updates, we hope you enjoy your time in the server even more~

### Chinese Thread

After some pestering from server members, we‚Äôve created the new [Chinese thread](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1168752239561678868/1168752239561678868). CamelliaÁöÑË°åÊîø‰∫∫ÂëòÈÉΩÊÉ≥ËÆ©ÊàëÂÜô‰∏Ä‰∏™Â•ΩÁ¨ëÁöÑ‰ø°ÊÅØÔºåÂõ†Ê≠§ÊàëÁé∞Âú®ÊÉ≥ËØ¥‰ªñ‰ª¨ÈÉΩÊòØÊúâÁâπÂà´ÊØõÁóÖÁöÑ‰∫∫-

### Aesthetic Changes

It‚Äôs time to spice things up with new-level role names and colors! We hope this will bring a fresh new look to parts of the server. We also took the time to add some icons to the side of channels and change up the welcome message in <#1033585407285272596>. As always, we welcome your suggestions on these changes in <#1034240760154947584>. We hope you enjoy the improvement! Cheers to next month~
