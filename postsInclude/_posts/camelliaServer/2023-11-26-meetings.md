### 11/26/23 Recap

Overview of the event chart for people that missed it.

![Professional Event Chart](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1158188418824683623/1178495479403794603/k3WlZOz.png?ex=65765a71&is=6563e571&hm=f1d21ceea858b9b3c8ecc6907b0cab7d74fe1d709b3bd69414299c306eb6f0cd&)

- Each member showed no disagreement on the event chart above.
- We discussed inviting the Adocord Event staff into the server. We will seperate them from the normal staff members due to them not being fully integrated within the Adocord's main staff team.
- We need to think of server events that unify us, which is why Adocord event staff are invited to join. More discussion on this will come at a later time.
- Game nights, streamer games were mentioned a little.

> We have also determined that there will be bias for events in general due to seperate interests. Judges will focus on community and objective thinking by reviewing all the submissions unified in the JMSC.

### 10/1/23 Recap

The second meeting.

> "[The JMSC is] going to be a place where the staff teams of our servers and potentially more servers in the future [collaborate]. [We could] choose to be in this place and basically [share our] knowledge with each other so that we are all more prepared to deal with situations in the future. We could also get everyone up-to-date on major dramas in the overall community."

>-David, Admin of Camellia's Official Server.

Server owners of the meeting start relaying opinions from their staff teams about the JMSC. Staff members of the Camellia Discord are already happy with the idea. Right now, the server is only open to the Admins/Owners of Ado Hangout, Inabakumori Station, and Camellia's Official Server.

> "I talked a little about it with our team. Generally, the opinion we have is "ehh". We're not like too in support nor are we against because we don't mind being apart of this at all. But, we don't see much of a point so I guess we would like some clarification of the positives that come from this."

> -Justin, owner of Inbakumori Station.

The positives are discussed and a summary is listed below:

- Getting easier connections with other big communities.
- Sharing a list of names of people to watch out for.
- More communication between our staff teams.
- Sharing resources. Bots, programming.
- Sharing information with each other.
- Possible staff lectures.
- Server event sharing.

Server admins have a general agreement on the connection and advice side of the JMSC. After discussion, more members are on board with the idea and the JMSC starts to take shape. Only staff members will be invited to this server, the server is kept private until it was determined "ready". The server will have manual verification. The old plans and ideas of the JMSC (formally the Artists' Network) are scrapped in favor for the new direction.

The meeting goes off-topic the majority of the time as discussion of the main topics have concluded.
