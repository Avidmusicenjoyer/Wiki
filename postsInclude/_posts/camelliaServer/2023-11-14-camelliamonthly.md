### We Drew Camellia Together, Again

With the success of the first edition, this time, we’ve asked you all to provide some birthday and spooky entries to this version! Assembled by [many artists](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1088625892105924648/1170498148049879152), we thank everyone who participated. Look out for another event like this in the future!

### Camellia Reaches 200k Followers on Xitter

Thank you to everyone for helping him reach this impressive milestone. Make sure to follow him on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/cametek.bsky.social) too!

### Song Releases - October

[Hou { Phoenix }](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/ddr/ddra3/p/): Camellia didn’t seem satisfied breaking our hands… so now he’s targeting our legs... The man has created a monster of a track in DDR A3’s “Babylon’s Galaxy” event as the ONE MORE EXTRA STAGE! Good luck to all those dancers; don’t break too many legs!

[i - ii](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/2dx/31/): What’s an IIDX game without Camellia in it? Bringing in his banger hi-tech psy style, get those DJ hands ready for some Metro Techno action with this unlockable song!

With another Hololive Collab, Camellia's brought us "まんなかちてん" by Luna Himemori! [Check it out here](https://youtu.be/M0Oud1_4sl0).

Camellia has also produced another song named "「Trick star」" by るなっち☆ほし. Be sure to [check it out too](https://youtu.be/1DngUauUYjg)!

### New Staff Members

 Some of you might notice that three new admins have joined us - <mark>@azunyan0007, @ungrave, and @nicocchi_,</mark> have come over from the Nanahira community to offer help! Feel free to welcome them if you see them interacting in general chat. With them helping out, our admin team now forms a cool heptagon (probably a more relaxed shape than a square?). We’re grateful they’ll be volunteering their time to help all of us out, and we look forward to working with them!

### Staff and Rules Updates

We have cut down *many* rules and combined some to make things more sane for new and existing members (from 17 down to 7!). We also added some clarification on current disclaimers as well as old ones. Please give them a read: <#1121280346638524456>. In parallel, we have also updated the Staff Guidelines again, adding an entirely [new section](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1088625892105924648/1164858060578230326) to it. An autobiography/transparency document was also [uploaded by papertek](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1088625892105924648/1167233462927904858), documenting his time in the community. Lastly, server moderation systems have switched off from Dyno to Wick. The full announcement is [here](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1088625892105924648/1169401636754563145). With these changes and updates, we hope you enjoy your time in the server even more~

### Chinese Thread

After some pestering from server members, we’ve created the new [Chinese thread](https://discord.com/channels/435720333786480641/1168752239561678868/1168752239561678868). Camellia的行政人员都想让我写一个好笑的信息，因此我现在想说他们都是有特别毛病的人-

### Aesthetic Changes

It’s time to spice things up with new-level role names and colors! We hope this will bring a fresh new look to parts of the server. We also took the time to add some icons to the side of channels and change up the welcome message in <#1033585407285272596>. As always, we welcome your suggestions on these changes in <#1034240760154947584>. We hope you enjoy the improvement! Cheers to next month~

## September 2023

It's time to get spooky, everyone, because Halloween is near, and your September monthly is here!
