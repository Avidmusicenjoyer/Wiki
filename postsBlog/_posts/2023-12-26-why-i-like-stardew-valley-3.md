## **Intro**

Stardew is a really fun game that I enjoy playing. The game starts with you talking to your grandpa at their house while at night while they're lying in bed with a nice warm fire burning in the fireplace behind them, he hands the player a envelope with instructions for them to open it when they feel crushed by the burden of modern life and when their bright spirit begins to fade before a growing emptiness. The intro cuts to 20 years later when you're working in Joja corporation at a cubicle work space. The player is surrounded by dark dirty cubicles working mindlessly at their computer, the player then open the note they received which reveals that your grandpa felt the same way you do so they dropped everything and decided to move to a place they truly belonged. They proceed to give you the deed to their farm located in Stardew valley. After this you move to Stardew valley you enter a town called Pelican town where the farm is located and when arriving you discover it to be in shambles, there's grass, wood, rocks, and trees overgrown everywhere. You're introduced to the wood worker and mayor of Pelican town as they greet you and give you a tour of the farm and teach you how to ship items and you go to sleep and your adventure starts. 



## the fun begins

From here on out the player is given full control, and the way you want to continue is entirely up to you. You could stay in the farm for the entire time and never talk to anyone or go anywhere else and it would still work. The fun in Stardew is there's no real objective, there's quests and story but there's no real losing or winning, the game is defined by what you make of it. You're able to pursue being just a farmer, fisher, miner, or whatever the player chooses to be fun. There's hundreds of crops and and ways to make money to help you with your farm and journey. I really enjoy Stardew Valley because you're able to take it slow or as fast as you want, if you want you could sleep through 10 years
