## Night One With Mark This is a Header Two

Hello everybody my name is Markiplier and welcome to Five Nights at Freddies, an indie horror game that you guys suggested in mass, and I saw that Yamimash played it and he said that it was really really good; so I’m very eager to see what is up - and that is a terrifying animatronic bear reads off script family pizzeria looking for security guard to work the night shift. Oh, 12:00 A.M, the first night. If I didn’t want to stay the first night, why would I stay any more than five? Why would I say anymore than two - hello. Okay...Hello? Hello - oh, ah I can’t move. That’s a creepy skull...There’s creepy things on the wall - Oh, hello. Phone Guy begins dialogue “Hello, hello hello,” Hi! “Uh, I wanted to record a message for you, to help you get settled in on your first night.” Eugh.. “Um, I actually worked in that office before you, and I’m finishing up my last week now as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming..” Euuagh..! “But I’m here to tell you, there’s nothing to worry about,” Agh.. “You’ll do fine! So, let’s just focus on getting you through your first week..” Okay! Sounds go- “Ah, let’s see..First there’s an introductory greeting from the company that I’m supposed to read - i-it’s kind of a legal thing, you know, ahm - ‘Welcome to Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza-” Okay “‘..A magical place for kids and grownups alike-” Mark wheezes indistinctly in the background Heheha.. “..Where fantasy and fun come to life,” Eugha..! “”Freddy Fazbear entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person, upon discovering that damage or death has occured, a missing person report will be filed within ninety days or as soon as property and premises had been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpet’s have been replaced,’ blah blah blah - now that might sound bad, I know, but-” Yeah! “-There’s really nothing to worry about! Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them?

No, if I was forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years, and I never got a bath, I’d probably be a bit irritable at night too. So just remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children, and you need show them a little respect, Right?” Okay! “-Okay-” Ha-okay! “So just be aware, the characters fo tend to wander a bit-” Nehaheugh- “They’re one some kinda of free-roaming mode-” hehauhuhugh! “Uhh.. Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for two long,” Oohoohoo- “Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day, too, but then there was the bite of eighty-seven.

Oh god, not again! Why would I do this? gibberish -my job? deep breath ookay, okay. So I ran out of power -but, phone rings oh hi, hi again. Do you have an se- sage advice for me? Yep, kay, yep. I know, yep, yep yep yep. What can I do for you? phone continues to ring I know! Phone guy’s dialogue plays once again oh god..”Hello, hello! Uh, well if you’re hearing this you made it to day two! Uh, congrats!” wheezes briefly hehe! “I won’t talk quite as long this time, since Freddy and his friends tend to become more active as the week progresses.” whispered what? “Uh, it might be a good idea to peek at those cameras while I talk, just to make sure everyone’s in their proper place-” No.. “Uh, interestingly enough, Freddy himself doesn’t come off stage very often, I’ve heard he becomes a lot more active in the dark though, so hey, I guess that’s one more reason not to run out of power, right?” Aeugh! “Uh - I also want to emphasize the importance of using your door light - uh, there are blind spots in your camera view, and those blind spots happen to be right outside your doors, so if you can’t find something, or someone on your cameras, make sure-” Eugh!” - to check the door light. Uh, you might only have a few seconds to react -uh, not that you would be in any danger, of course. Uh, far from that. Also, uhh, check on the curtain in Pirate Cove from time to time, the character in there seems to be weakened
